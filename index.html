              I specialize in transforming intricate datasets into actionable insights that drive informed decision-making. Through a project focused on road safety analysis, I adeptly performed comprehensive data extraction, transformation, and loading using SQL. Leveraging powerful tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, I dissected the data to uncover critical trends. My visualization expertise came to the forefront as I designed interactive visuals, offering deep insights into accident severity, casualty demographics, and historical trends. These insights were distilled into informative graphics and interactive dashboards, facilitating location and time analysis for stakeholders. Through these efforts, I facilitated evidence-based policy formulation, empowered informed decision-making, and contributed to the advancement of effective road safety measures.
